    <h2> Staying safe </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Please stay home if you're sick -- if you're coughing, feverish, or have recently been exposed to someone with COVID-19, do not join the protests and put more people at risk. </li>
        <li> Wash your hands or sanitize frequently, especially after touching others or shared surfaces. </li>
        <li> Wear a mask (both to avoid COVID-19 and tear gas). </li>
        <li> Keep a six-foot distance between yourself and fellow protestors. </li>
        <li> Do not wear contacts -- both pepper spray and tear gas activate pain-sensing nerves in your eyes.  </li>
        <li> Similarly, avoid makeup or lotion -- they can trap tear gas against your skin and make it more painful. </li>
